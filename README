Things to do:
(0) The algorithm in the slides is wrong!!!
(1) Coding and verify the basic, openmp only, MPI only, openmp coupled with MPI
(2) Varying the parallel thread ans OMP node, compare the results with the basic one
(3) Change the matrix size to M*N

Process and Records:
(1) Create the basic gauss seidel and openmp gauss seidel 
(2) Need to verify the codes-> current result shows the openmp works, however it spends more time than the basic case.
